## Recognition Accuracy Features

### Geometric Features Used:
1. **Finger Distances**: Distance from each fingertip to palm center
2. **Finger Angles**: Angle of each finger relative to palm
3. **Hand Orientation**: Overall hand angle
4. **Finger Spread**: Distance between adjacent fingertips
5. **Thumb Position**: Thumb-index finger distance
6. **Hand Compactness**: Width/height ratio of bounding box
7. **Finger Curvature**: Sum of joint angles for each finger

### Letter Recognition Patterns:
- **A**: Closed fist with thumb up (high compactness, thumb extended)
- **B**: Flat hand (low compactness, fingers extended)
- **L**: L-shape (thumb and index at 90° angle)
- **O**: Circle shape (curved fingers, moderate compactness)
- **V**: Peace sign (two fingers spread apart)
- **Y**: Shaka sign (thumb and pinky extended)

## System Performance
- **Processing Speed**: ~3 frames per second analysis
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.75 (higher accuracy)
- **Temporal Smoothing**: 10-frame history
- **Frame Enhancement**: Histogram equalization + Gaussian blur
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and logging

## Web Interface Features
